        "\n",
        "## Why do we need \"aperiodic\"？\n",
        "Stationary distribution is an important property in Markov chain theory. For a discrete time and finite state space Markov chain, being \"irreducible\" and \"aperiodic\" implies it has one and only one stationary distribution. \n",
        "\n",
        "Compared with irreducibility, aperiodicity is a less intuitive concept. \n",
        "\n",
        "For state $s_i$, the definition of aperiodicty tells us that $gcd(N_i) := gcd\\{n\\ge1: (P^n)_{i,i}>0\\}=1$, but it does not necessarily mean that 1 is an element in $N_i$.In other words, we don't have $P_{i,i}>0$ yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, being aperiodic leads us to Thm 4.1, which says \"there exists a $N<\\inf$ such that $(P^n)_{i,i}>0$ for all $n>N$\". In other words, when $n>N$ and the chain move forward one step, we can always go from state $i$ to $i$ with positive probability. This is very nice as it **gives hopes for convergence when $n$ goes to infinity**. The proof of Thm 4.1 utilizes a lemma from number theory which guarantees that all the $n$ after $N$ belongs to the set $N_i$. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Example: Aperiodic or periodic Markov chain?\n",
        "To determine whether a Markov chain is aperiodic or not, there are some creterions that can be applied. \n",
        "\n",
        "Step 1. We can draw a transition diagram from the transition matrix if the number of states are not too many. With the diagram, we can easily tell if the Markov chain is irreducible or not. \n",

        "Therefore, we can look at only one of their states for the full information of periodicity. \n",
        "\n",
        "For the chain on the left, state 1 has periods of 2, 4, ..., therefore its period is 2. State 1 is periodic and then the whole chain is not aperiodic. Simimlarly, look at state 1 (in the center). It has periods of 3, 6, ..., and thus its period is 3. The MC on the right is not aperiodic either. \n",

        "\n",
        "*Proof*: $P_{i,i} > 0$ means the chain can come to state $i$ from state i in one step, and thus the period of i (gcd{$n\\ge1: P^n_{i,i}>0$}) is 1. As we mentioned in step2, all the states have the same period for irreducible MC, and thus the chain is aperiodic. "
