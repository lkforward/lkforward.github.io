        "## 1. Background\n",
        "Mesoscale organization of shallow clouds is a challenging topic in the studies of clouds and climate. It is frequently observed in satellite imagery but not yet well understood in the research community. Scientists have come up with four common categories of mesoscale organizations: Flower, Fish, Sugar and Gravel. For a full description of the characteristics of each group, you are referred to [1]. In figure 1, several samples are presented to illustrate the difference among the four categories. \n",

        "|:--:| \n",
        "| *Figure 1. Examples of the four different patterns found in shallow clouds organizations* |\n",
        "\n",
        "As labeling such patterns requires a large amount of time and efforts by scientists and researchers, in this project we are moving a step forward to see if a deep learning algorithm is able to generalize the knowledge in clouds organization and identify those patterns correctly and robustly. This research will guide the development of next-generation climate models with less uncertainty in clouds. If successful, we can help scientists to better understand how clouds will shape our future climate. \n",
        "\n",
        "This challenge is formalized as Kaggle data science competition (reference [2]). In this article, I will go through a solution and share some thoughts from there. "

        "The training dataset consists of 22184/4 = 5546 satellite images (provided by the Kaggle competition; also available from NASA Worldview) covering three regions, spanning 21 degrees longitude and 14 degrees latitude. The true-color images were taken from two polar-orbiting satellites, TERRA and AQUA, each of which pass a specific region once a day. \n",
        "\n",
        "The labels were created in a crowd-sourcing activity at the Max-Planck-Institite for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, and the Laboratoire de météorologie dynamique in Paris, France ([1]). A team of 68 scientists identified areas of cloud patterns in each image, and each images was labeled by approximately 3 different scientists. Ground truth was determined by the union of the areas marked by all labelers for that image, after removing any black band area from the areas.\n",

        "It should be pointed out that n image might be stitched together from two orbits (due to the small footprint of the imager (MODIS) on board these satellites). The remaining area, which has not been covered by two succeeding orbits, is marked black.\n",
        " \n",
        "The task of the competition is to develop machine learning algorithms that can generate similar masks (for the four classes: flower, fish, sugar and gravel) and deploy such algorithms to identify the cloud organization type for each given satellite image. "
